		<div id="about_text">
			<p>My name is Logan Starr (maybe now the logo makes sense) Smith, and I'm a product guy splitting time between Nairobi and NYC.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I like tackling big problems with a mix of empathy and technology. The former opens up all possible solutions; the latter usually solves problems more efficiently. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I got hooked on health early in my career (in the US) because it was and is the hardest nut to crack in America. But after a while of working in the digital health space in SF and NYC as a product manager and developer, I thought my not-yet-senior skills could provide more marginal value in the global health space. </p>
			<br>
			<p>So I spent the last year in Uganda as a tech lead for a health NGO, tweaking open-source products for the government. And now I'm based in Nairobi doing a design fellowship to hone in on how best to use human-centered design concepts. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Last bit: I love keeping busy with side projects, so shoot me a note if you have something fun on which we can work. On top of health, I'm super interested in criminal justice reform, financial inclusion, and simplified voting initiatives.
