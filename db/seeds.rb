design_process = Category.create({project_id: 1, name: "Design Process", project_text: "I first sat with my public health gurus / coworkers at the Clinton Health Access Initiative and asked (ish) the following quetions:

- Who do you think the key users are?
- What data will be the most actionable for them on a daily/ weekly/ monthly basis?
- Do we have approval to display __ data? 
- Are there any tradeoffs to showing data at a granular level? (for example, down to the health facility level)
- How do you think the key users most like to consume this data? 
- What are the most annoying parts about the way the data is disseminated and displayed now? 

I then had the same conversation with other teams and started to see some similarities. Amongst them:

- Each team had 3-4 key indicators they like to display
- Most teams want to filter by date and location, and also have 1-2 other important filters
- Trends (ex. to indicate seasonality) are important
- There are other statistics which are less actionable but need to be seen in aggregate on a regular basis

So I started sketching and prototyping some initial versions. "})
